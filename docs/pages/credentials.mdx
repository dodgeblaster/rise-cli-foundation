# Credentials

## Introduction

Credentials are utils for configuring AWS Credentials

## filesystem.setConfig

This method of setting credentials works well if no credentials
are set on the machine. This scenario may happen for example in CICD pipelines
when credentials may be passed in as env variables

```ts
import utils from 'rise-cli-foundation'
import AWS_SDK_TO_CONFIGURE from 'aws-sdk'
const AWS = await utils.setConfig({
    AWS: AWS_SDK_TO_CONFIGURE,
    key: 'AWS_CREDENTIALS_KEY',
    secret: 'AWS_CREDENTIALS_SECRET',
    region: 'us-east-1'
})
```

## filesystem.setCredentials

This method of setting credentials works well when a user
has AWS credentials setup on their machine under `~/.aws/credentials`.
Here we are setting up the sdk with a profile defined in that file

```ts
import utils from 'rise-cli-foundation'
import AWS_SDK_TO_CONFIGURE from 'aws-sdk'
const AWS = await utils.setCredentials({
    AWS: AWS_SDK_TO_CONFIGURE,
    profile: 'PROFILE_FROM_LOCAL_CREDENTIALS_FILE',
    region: 'us-east-1'
})
```
